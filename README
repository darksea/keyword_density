KeywordDensity
==============

Simple rails plugin that will count words of more than two characters in a string. 
It uses a stop list, which can be supplied by the user. Options exist to give, say, 
the top 5 keywords and their relative frequency.

The purpose is to rank content for pushing to a suite of sister sites. 

caveats:

Assumes the content is free of tags.
